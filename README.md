# COVID-19 and E. coli Bacteria Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains code and data related to the analysis of COVID-19 and E. coli bacteria conducted for a Gilbert research question. The analysis aims to investigate various aspects of these two pathogens, exploring their genomic characteristics, epidemiological trends, and potential interactions.

## Contents
1. **Data:** 
   - Raw data files used in the analysis.
   - Preprocessed datasets ready for analysis.

2. **Code:**
   - Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
   - R scripts for statistical analysis and visualization.

3. **Results:**
   - Visualizations, tables, and summary reports of the analysis results.
   - Any supplementary materials or presentations.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning and formatting of raw data.
   - Integration of COVID-19 and E. coli datasets.

2. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Hypothesis testing to identify significant differences or correlations.
   - Regression analysis to model relationships between variables.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Graphical representations of analysis results.
   - Interactive plots for exploring data trends.

4. **Interpretation and Conclusion:**
   - Discussion of key findings.
   - Implications of the analysis results for the research question.

## Usage
1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure Python (version >= 3.0) and R (version >= 3.0) are installed.
